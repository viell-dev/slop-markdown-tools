 * item, where it would interrupt a paragraph, as CommonMark says, but also
 * where no paragraph is open: at the start of a list item, block quote, or
 * footnote definition below a paragraph, and after an indented code block
 * (issue #191). It reads the line as text there, where GitHub, commonmark.js,
 * and markdown-it read a list. By CommonMark's rules, text can start with a
 * list marker only below a link reference definition, as what remains of the
 * definition's lines; GitHub and commonmark.js read text there too, and
 * markdown-it a list. The paragraph of a task list item starts after its
 * checkbox, which renderers read as the start of the item's text, so it does
 * not count. Renderers read the `===` below such text as text, of the list
 * item or after an empty one, so a paragraph or heading on the next line
 * continues it too, and a block there is nested: a `---` would underline it.
